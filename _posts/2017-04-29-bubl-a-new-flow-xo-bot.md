# Bubl - A new Flow XO bot

This really will be a test, Flow XO can interact with a huge amount of 3rd party services, including Twitter. The test here will be to see if we can get Bubl to retweet or post on the [@BublBot][0] twitter page.. this could take a while, I'll update when we have success..!

\*\*update ok so you can now ask Bubl what is their twitter name.. then follow the dialogue and see your shoutout on the [@BublBot][0] twitter page. During the dialogue, when asked your name, you can either type it, or use your twitter ID.. either or..

Now curious what else we can do...
