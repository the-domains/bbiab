# Flow XO Bot

This is interesting, an online bot creator with no coding needed from a company called [Flow XO][0] . This was literally set up in 5 minutes, using all default setting, but you can see if you click the speech bubble, it opens up on this site.

You can ask about shipping costs and opening times, so could be good for an online shop. Like most bots you need to add more of a structured chat.. I'll add some more flows to make it more useful.. also which is the best / most popular product / seller.. who is the owner / designer etc.. (apologies to [@GoAti][1] for borrowing an image or two... :p )

### \*\*update added cards and images for when you ask for the most popular, and now also the latest products (which uses a card set).

The positioning of the bot maybe problematic though, unless we can anchor it somewhere within thegrid.io set up.
